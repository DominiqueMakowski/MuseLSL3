## Packet Header Structure

### Confirmed: 14-Byte Header Format

**Source**: `validate_subpkts.py`  
**Validation**: 100% validation success across 15,686 packets from multiple presets

```
Byte Offset | Field Name        | Type      | Description
------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------
0           | PKT_LEN        | uint8     | Declared packet length (includes header)
1           | PKT_N          | uint8     | Packet counter (0-255, wraps around)
2-5         | PKT_T          | uint32 LE | Timestamp in milliseconds (device time)
6-8         | PKT_UNKNOWN1   | 3 bytes   | Reserved/unknown (consistent per preset)
9           | PKT_ID         | uint8     | Frequency (high nibble) + Type (low nibble)
10-11       | metadata_u16_0    | uint16 LE | High-variance counter (NOT sample count)
12          | metadata_u16_1_lo | uint8     | Low byte, values 0-3
13          | ALWAYS_ZERO       | uint8     | Separator/padding (confirmed 100% = 0x00)
14+         | DATA              | variable  | Sample data (length = PKT_LEN - 14)
```

### Key Validations

1. **Byte 13 is always 0x00** (100% confirmed)
   - Tested in: `validate_subpkts.py`
   - Method: Checked all 15,686 packets across all presets
   
2. **PKT_ID for ACCGYRO = 0x47 or 0x57** (type nibble = 0x7)
   - Tested in: `validate_subpkts.py`, `validate_tag_decoder.py`
   - Method: Filtered packets by type nibble, confirmed data contains ACC+GYRO
   
3. **PKT_LEN matches actual packet length** (100% match)
   - Tested in: `validate_subpkts.py`
   - Method: Compared declared length with actual payload boundaries
   
4. **PKT_N increments sequentially** (with wraparound at 255)
   - Tested in: `validate_subpkts.py`
   - Method: Tracked counter across consecutive packets
   
5. **metadata_u16_0 has NO correlation with data length** (correlation ≈ 0.0)
   - Tested in: `validate_PKT_DATA.py`
   - Method: Statistical correlation analysis between u16_0 and data_length

## Data Section Structure

### Confirmed: Continuous Stream of 12-Byte Samples

**Source**: `final_decoder_test.py`  
**Validation**: 97.59% average coverage, 99.4% of packets >95% coverage

The data section (bytes 14+) contains a **continuous stream** of tightly-packed 12-byte samples:

```
[Sample 1: 12 bytes] [Sample 2: 12 bytes] [Sample 3: 12 bytes] ...
```

**Critical Discovery**: There are **NO structural headers or delimiters** between samples.

### What About the "Tag Bytes" (0x47, 0xF4)?

**Source**: `analyze_block_timing.py`, `test_tag_separation.py`  
**Validation**: Byte-by-byte analysis of values after apparent "tags"

**CONFIRMED**: The bytes 0x47 (71) and 0xF4 (244) are **NOT structural tags** - they are **sample data values** that happen to appear in the int16 stream!

Evidence:
1. Values after "tags" decode as valid GYRO_Y and GYRO_Z samples (±0.5 deg/s)
2. "4-byte headers" follow pattern `[X, 0, Y, 0]` = two int16 LE values
3. These values match expected gyroscope readings for stationary device
4. Treating entire data as continuous samples achieves 97.59% coverage

Example from `analyze_block_timing.py`:
```
"Header" [71, 0, 81, 0] → GYRO_Y = -0.53 deg/s, GYRO_Z = -0.61 deg/s ✓
"Header" [73, 0, 66, 0] → GYRO_Y = -0.55 deg/s, GYRO_Z = -0.49 deg/s ✓
```

## Sample Format

### Confirmed: 6-Channel, 12-Byte Sample Structure

**Source**: `validate_GYROACC3.py`, `final_decoder_test.py`  
**Validation**: Decoded samples produce physically reasonable values

Each sample contains **6 channels** (3 accelerometer + 3 gyroscope):

```
Byte Offset | Channel   | Type      | Scale Factor    | Units
------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------
0-1         | ACC_X     | int16 LE  | 0.0000610352    | g (gravity)
2-3         | ACC_Y     | int16 LE  | 0.0000610352    | g (gravity)
4-5         | ACC_Z     | int16 LE  | 0.0000610352    | g (gravity)
6-7         | GYRO_X    | int16 LE  | -0.0074768      | deg/s
8-9         | GYRO_Y    | int16 LE  | -0.0074768      | deg/s
10-11       | GYRO_Z    | int16 LE  | -0.0074768      | deg/s
```

### Scale Factors Confirmed

**Source**: Original `MuseLSL3/decode.py`, validated in testing scripts  
**Method**: Applied scales produce physically reasonable values for stationary device

- **ACC_SCALE = 0.0000610352**: Produces ~±1g for stationary device (gravity)
- **GYRO_SCALE = -0.0074768**: Produces ~0 deg/s for stationary device (no rotation)

## Key Discoveries

### 1. The "5-Byte Prefix" Mystery (SOLVED)

**Source**: `analyze_prefix_bytes.py`, `test_consistent_decoder.py`  
**Finding**: 91% of packets have 5 bytes before first apparent "tag"

**Explanation**: These 5 bytes are the **last 5 bytes of a partial sample**:
- Byte pattern: `[ACC_Z_byte1, GYRO_X (2 bytes), GYRO_Y_byte0]`
- The apparent "tag" at position 5 is actually GYRO_Y_byte1 (happens to be 0x47 or 0xF4)
- This is just **data crossing arbitrary boundaries**

Evidence from `test_consistent_decoder.py`:
```
Prefix [a7, c1, 9d, fe, 72] decoded as:
  ACC_Z = -0.9742 g ✓
  GYRO_X = 2.6543 deg/s ✓
  (reasonable for stationary device tilted by gravity)
```

### 2. Why Tags Don't Separate ACC from GYRO (CONFIRMED)

**Source**: `test_tag_separation.py`  
**Finding**: Packets have 0-3 occurrences of 0x47 and 2-10 occurrences of 0xF4

**Conclusion**: These are **not** separate tags for ACC vs GYRO. They are just byte values that happen to occur in the int16 sample stream.

Evidence:
- 26.7% of packets have ONLY 0xF4, 0% have ONLY 0x47
- Block sizes after "tags" are similar (~34-35 bytes), not different
- Both "ACC" and "GYRO" interpretations work at various offsets → data is mixed, not separated

### 3. Why "Strategy 2" Achieves Best Coverage (EXPLAINED)

**Source**: `final_decoder_test.py`  
**Result**: 97.59% average coverage

**Strategy 2**: "Skip tag bytes (0x47, 0xF4), decode everything else as 12-byte samples"

Why this works:
- 0x47 and 0xF4 are rare enough that skipping them doesn't lose much data
- The remaining bytes are indeed continuous samples
- The ~2.4% uncovered bytes are likely:
  - Actual tags that are metadata (rare)
  - Partial samples at packet boundaries
  - Padding bytes

### 4. Packet Boundaries and Continuation (HYPOTHESIS)

**Source**: `analyze_prefix_bytes.py`, observations across multiple packets  
**Not fully confirmed, but strongly suggested**

The "5-byte prefix" pattern suggests that **samples can span packet boundaries**:
- Last sample of Packet N might be incomplete
- First bytes of Packet N+1 complete that sample
- This would explain the consistent 5-byte prefix (7 bytes from previous packet + 5 bytes in current = 12-byte sample)

**Recommended approach**: Maintain a buffer for incomplete samples when processing sequential packets.

## Recommended Decoder Implementation

### Simple Decoder (Single Packet)

For decoding a single ACCGYRO packet in isolation:

```python
import struct

ACC_SCALE = 0.0000610352
GYRO_SCALE = -0.0074768

def decode_accgyro_packet(packet_bytes):
    """
    Decode a single ACCGYRO packet.
    
    Args:
        packet_bytes: Raw bytes of the packet (including header)
    
    Returns:
        dict with:
            - timestamp: uint32 ms from device start
            - counter: uint8 packet counter
            - samples: list of (acc_x, acc_y, acc_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z) tuples
    """
    if len(packet_bytes) < 14:
        return None
    
    # Parse header
    length = packet_bytes[0]
    counter = packet_bytes[1]
    timestamp = struct.unpack('<I', packet_bytes[2:6])[0]
    packet_id = packet_bytes[9]
    
    # Verify ACCGYRO packet (type nibble = 7)
    if (packet_id & 0x0F) != 7:
        return None
    
    # Extract data section
    data = packet_bytes[14:]
    
    # Decode samples (12 bytes each)
    samples = []
    offset = 0
    
    while offset + 12 <= len(data):
        # Read 6 int16 values (little-endian)
        sample_bytes = data[offset:offset+12]
        raw_values = struct.unpack('<6h', sample_bytes)
        
        # Apply scale factors
        acc_x = raw_values[0] * ACC_SCALE
        acc_y = raw_values[1] * ACC_SCALE
        acc_z = raw_values[2] * ACC_SCALE
        gyro_x = raw_values[3] * GYRO_SCALE
        gyro_y = raw_values[4] * GYRO_SCALE
        gyro_z = raw_values[5] * GYRO_SCALE
        
        samples.append((acc_x, acc_y, acc_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z))
        offset += 12
    
    return {
        'timestamp': timestamp,
        'counter': counter,
        'samples': samples,
        'leftover_bytes': len(data) - offset
    }
```

### Advanced Decoder (Handling Packet Boundaries)

For processing a stream of packets with potential sample continuation:

```python
def decode_accgyro_stream(packets):
    """
    Decode a stream of ACCGYRO packets, handling samples that span boundaries.
    
    Args:
        packets: Iterable of packet_bytes
    
    Yields:
        dict with timestamp, counter, and list of complete samples
    """
    buffer = b''  # Buffer for incomplete samples
    
    for packet_bytes in packets:
        if len(packet_bytes) < 14:
            continue
        
        # Parse header
        length = packet_bytes[0]
        counter = packet_bytes[1]
        timestamp = struct.unpack('<I', packet_bytes[2:6])[0]
        packet_id = packet_bytes[9]
        
        # Verify ACCGYRO
        if (packet_id & 0x0F) != 7:
            continue
        
        # Extract data and prepend any buffered bytes
        data = buffer + packet_bytes[14:]
        buffer = b''
        
        # Decode complete samples
        samples = []
        offset = 0
        
        while offset + 12 <= len(data):
            sample_bytes = data[offset:offset+12]
            raw_values = struct.unpack('<6h', sample_bytes)
            
            acc_x = raw_values[0] * ACC_SCALE
            acc_y = raw_values[1] * ACC_SCALE
            acc_z = raw_values[2] * ACC_SCALE
            gyro_x = raw_values[3] * GYRO_SCALE
            gyro_y = raw_values[4] * GYRO_SCALE
            gyro_z = raw_values[5] * GYRO_SCALE
            
            samples.append((acc_x, acc_y, acc_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z))
            offset += 12
        
        # Buffer any incomplete sample at the end
        if offset < len(data):
            buffer = data[offset:]
        
        yield {
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'counter': counter,
            'samples': samples
        }
```

### Validation Checks

When implementing a decoder, verify:

1. **Byte 13 == 0x00**: Confirms proper packet alignment
2. **Type nibble == 7**: Confirms ACCGYRO packet
3. **Declared length matches actual**: Confirms complete packet
4. **ACC_Z ≈ ±1g**: Gravity should be visible on one axis (stationary device)
5. **GYRO ≈ 0**: Gyroscope near zero for stationary device
6. **Coverage ≥ 90%**: Most data bytes should decode to samples

## Update: Tag-Based Decoder Structure Discovered (October 2025)

### What Failed

**Initial Approach (validate_GYROACC5.py v1)**:
- ❌ Decoded data section as continuous 12-byte samples
- ❌ Filtered for ACCGYRO-only packets (type nibble = 7)
- ❌ Used device timestamps (milliseconds from device start)
- **Result**: 61.5 Hz sample rate (20% too high), noisy signals, 97.55% coverage

**Problem Identified**:
- Data sections had 23% more bytes than expected for 52 Hz @ 60s
- Data lengths were NOT multiples of 12 bytes (remainders of 1, 2, 5, 9 bytes)
- Average 40 extra bytes per packet
- Signals showed random sharp spikes (contamination from non-sample bytes)

### What Worked

**Tag-Based Decoder Structure (validate_GYROACC5.py v2)**:
- ✅ Scan **ENTIRE packet** (including header) for 0x47 tag bytes
- ✅ Process **ALL messages** (not just ACCGYRO-filtered)
- ✅ For each 0x47 tag: skip 5 bytes (tag + 4-byte header), decode 36 bytes (3 samples)
- ✅ Use **Bluetooth receive timestamps** (not device timestamps) for time axis
- **Result**: 58.2 Hz sample rate, all sanity checks PASS, realistic signal patterns

**Key Discoveries**:
1. **0x47 serves dual purpose**: 
   - Appears at byte 9 as packet ID for ACCGYRO packets
   - Also appears throughout data section as block markers
2. **Tag + header structure**:
   - When 0x47 is at position 9 (packet ID), skipping 5 bytes → position 14 (data start)
   - When 0x47 is in data section, skipping 5 bytes → next sample block
3. **Fixed block size**: Each 0x47 tag marks exactly 3 samples (36 bytes)
4. **Cross-message scanning**: 0x47 tags appear in EEG and other packet types too

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ ACC magnitude: 1.041 ± 0.290 g (expected ~1.0g for gravity)
- ✅ GYRO mean: 1.740 deg/s (expected <5 deg/s for stationary device)
- ✅ Sample rate: 58.2 ± 0.5 Hz (within expected 50-100 Hz range)
- ✅ Duration: ~60 seconds (matches Bluetooth timestamp span)

### Refinement with Continuity Validation (GYROACC6)

**Problem**: Despite correct structure, signals showed contamination (sharp spikes, 58.2 Hz vs expected 52 Hz).

**Solution**: Added continuity validation between samples in each 3-sample block:
- Check that consecutive samples don't jump more than 1.0g (ACC) or 200 deg/s (GYRO)
- Reject entire 3-sample blocks that show discontinuities

**Results**:
- ✅ **50.3 ± 0.2 Hz** sample rate (very close to nominal 52 Hz!)
- ✅ Rejected 13.65% of samples (1,926 false positives filtered out)
- ✅ ACC magnitude: **1.009 ± 0.063 g** (more consistent than 1.041 ± 0.290)
- ✅ GYRO std dev: **36-49 deg/s** (reduced from 50-61 deg/s)
- ✅ GYRO mean: **0.946 deg/s** (closer to zero for stationary device)
- ✅ Much cleaner signals without sharp spikes

**Conclusion**: The tag-based decoder with continuity validation successfully removes false positive samples while maintaining 86% of decoded data. This is the recommended approach for production use.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement the simple decoder** and test on your data
2. **Validate coverage**: Aim for ≥95% of data bytes decoded
3. **Test on multiple presets**: Ensure consistency across different configurations
4. **Handle boundary cases**: Implement buffering for sample continuation
5. **Compare with ground truth**: If available, validate against known movements
